# interactive_form_project

This project was focused on creating form validation and manipulating form elements using vanilla Javascript. 
The following skills were used for this: 

DOM traversal
Unobtrusive Javascript
Regex
Basic Funcitons and Loops
Conditional statements
Use of flags to setup form validation


The Goals for the project were to show and hide form fields depending on options selected. 
the Form inputs are also validated live as a user inputs info. 
At least one of the form fields (credit card number) gives conditional errors.
The form should still work with Javascript disabled.
